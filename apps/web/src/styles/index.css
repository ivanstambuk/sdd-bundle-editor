/* ========================================
   Main Style Entry Point
   ======================================== 
   
   This file orchestrates the CSS import order for the application.
   The order matters:
   1. tokens.css   - Design tokens (CSS custom properties)
   2. themes.css   - Theme-specific overrides
   3. globals.css  - Base reset and typography
   4. utilities.css - Utility classes
   5. styles.css   - Component styles (legacy, being migrated)
   
   As components are migrated to CSS Modules, their styles will be
   removed from styles.css and co-located with their components.

@import './tokens.css';

/* Legacy component styles - will shrink as CSS Modules migration progresses */
